# Testing

1.Sign in page:
    1. Being able to sign in with spotify
    2. Not being able to sign in with other people's spotify.

2.Leaderboard page:
    1. Not being able to display username



When the page size is intefered, the layout of the design will change accordingly. Certain parts of the website will be overstretched or too small due to improper coding.


I couldnt link the Spotify API to the website as the access token was hard to get and the Spotify API was very complicated.
